I don't know why I made this xD. One day I was searching through the internet to watch Doraemon Hindi Episodes  (ðŸ˜ŒTo relive my old childhood days..) <br />
But couldn't able to find a single website which lets me download all seasons at onceðŸ˜‘. <br />
Almost all websites just mentioned the link for each individual episodes
which was kind of frustating for anyone. I don't have time to click each link. <br />
So I thought to write a script that will do the job for me. <br />
First I selected a website which has currently 18 seasons in it, then I scraped it and stored each episodes with their respective download links in an Array. <br />
After that I wrote a function for downloading those episodes or season. <br />
It took me three hours to write this scriptðŸ˜ª.<br />
Hope it'll be useful to someone. <br />
Below I wrote some steps... No coding knowledge is needed to watch doraemonðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

### Steps
- Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.dev/)
- Git Clone the project or download zip directly
    - Enter this command ``` git clone https://github.com/anurag0608/doraemon-episodes ```
    - or download [zip](https://github.com/anurag0608/doraemon-episodes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it anywhere you want
- Go inside the root directory i.e ``` /doraemon-episodes/app/ ```
- open command prompt here 
- type ``` npm install ```
- then ``` npm start ```

Now just follow the steps... It'll ask you "Which season you want to download ?" <br />
Just enter it and wait.. Each episode's download progress will be shown <br />
A ``` downloads ``` folder will be created in the project root directory <br />
All episodes will be downloaded there only with their respective season.

Happy Doraemon to you! ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
